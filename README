a learning replacement for cd

INSTALL
  source into .bashrc under your '[-z "$PS1" ] || return' line
  cd around for a while

USE:
  cd [-l] [regex1 ... regexn]
    regex1 ... regexn jump to the most used directory matching all masks
    -l                show the list instead of jumping
    -s                show matched directory, but do not actually cd
                      with no args, go to home directory
